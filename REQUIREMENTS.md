Build the following pages that powered by the XML data:

1) Table view of all the inspections - a table can have the following data (does not have to look like the mockup)

With the ability to filter by BASIC category and sort by field.

The inspection detail view will look like this (please note if I need you to implement pixel to pixel I would already provided our Figma file, but this is just for illustration so please feel free to use your own framework that you’re comfortable with)

In this you won’t have driver data so don’t worry about that. But you will have the truck and trailer data.

Bonus (if you’re bored and really have more time before the next call):

- Make the truck and trailer in the inspection clickable which will take to the Truck and Trailer profile view which will list some info on the truck and trailer
    - You can parse the information of the truck or trailer using this VIN Decoder: https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/ (that way you will have make, year etc)
    - Showing the inspection(s) related to these vehicles and also the the linked equipment based on the last inspection data (which trailer is linked to what trailer)
- Lastly, anything you want to add to really make this a useful tool.
